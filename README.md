### Data Link Layer

OMNeT++ is an object-oriented modular discrete event network simulation framework. It has a generic
architecture, so it can be (and has been) used in modeling of wired and wireless communication networks,
protocol modeling, modeling of queuing networks and in general, modeling and simulation of any system
where the discrete event approach is suitable, and can be conveniently mapped into entities communicating
by exchanging messages. This homework guides you through building a data link layer protocol, showing you
along the way some of the commonly used OMNeT++ features. To practically follow the steps, having a good
C++ knowledge, and being in general familiar with C/C++ development (editing source files, compiling,
debugging etc.) is necessary.
